	<br />
	The rather simple scratch diagram shows a "memory interface" to the fpga. 
	Each triacdriver has got it's own address and the triac trigger delay can be 
	entered as a ten bit positive integer in the range of&nbsp; 0 to 1024. A half 
	cycle of AC (10 mSecs in our 220 V public current) is divided by 1024 and 
	the integer describes the point of time in this interval when triac trigger 
	takes place. <br />
	<br />
	The zeropass detector is needed because the triacdriver needs to be synchronised 
	with the AC timing.<br />
	<br />
	The fpga finally transmits the different trigger current pulses to the triac drivers 
	with a trigger duration of approx 5 uSecs. To be able to switch highly 
	inductive loads, a pulse train will be sent after the initial pulse with an 
	interval time of approx. 100 uSecs, what means approx 10 pulses per mSec.<br />
